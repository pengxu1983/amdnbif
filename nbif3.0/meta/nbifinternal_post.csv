*pls also add mpio/mpio_dram client information to this mas, and add this file link to mi200 main mas.* 
h3. 1.1.1       SystemHub <-> SMU IP Master Interface 

Note: 
* MPx(DRAM) as AXI master and SystemHub as AXI slave 
* SMU IP includes MP* (MP0, MP1, MP1DRAM, MP2 and MP4) and ZCN 
* 48bit address 
* MP0 is with 256bit data width, MP1/MP1DRAM is with 64bit data width, MP2 is with 32bit data width, MP4/ZCN is with 512bit data width 
* Max burst size supported is 256B 
* MP1DRAM would only issue DMA traffic which is connected to SDP VC7, MP1 would only issue MMIO/CFG/IO/MSG which is connected to SDP VC0/1. 
* MP0 would issue DRAM/MMIO/CFG/IO which is mapped to SDP VC0/1

The original reason is smn_vwr should propogate these register value out when warm_reset is triggered. 
When we have smn_vwr, it need clock awake. reset process need clock awake, it is reasonable. 
When we do not have smn_vwr, it is tied to 0, which means smn_vwr need need clock active.

*Subject:* RE: [MI200] BIGAPU_MODE comes from PIN? 

  

If nBIF is using ROM and FUSE strapping currently, we could re-consider this.  I just found out the PCIE IP is using ROM strap as well for mode selection. +Moiz, Cc Theta/Mary/Andy/Fengming 

  

But we would like to request aligned default states for the 2 IPs and leave the production values to be OPN if possible, below is what we know now: 

  
|IP|Strap name|Fuse or ROM stap|Default| 
|nBIF|STRAP_BIF_STRAP_BIGAPU_MODE|Fuse and ROM(ROM override fuse??)|0 
dGPU SW.DS mode| 
|PCIE|STRAP_CHIP_BIF_MODE|ROM only|1 (0x1FF) 
bigAPU RC mode| 

  

  

Hi *_Moiz_*, can we change the default PCIE-host-attached mode to SW.US mode instead of RC mode?

I don't think it's best to add a preinclude to clear the queue. 

nbif made an error msg fuzzy checker. 

fuzzy Checkers knob: 

*err_msg_fuzzy_en (0/1) default is 0:* 

Enable the aer error msg fuzzy checker. 

*strict_level (value: 0/1/2) default is 2*: 

Value 0: No master error msg streamid, just clear iohub_dma_req_scbd/iohub_dma_req_scbd/clear_pred_gmi_err_msg_trans/clear_pred_gmi_ds_err_msg_trans 

Value 1: When msg comes from the same device, err msg is merged. 

Value 2: Err msg is merged when the error msg streamid is the same. 

I think you can try setting err_msg_type_fuzzy_en=1.strict_level =0 . nbif then clears the queues.

     We have hang protect function to flush in syshub/gdc. But from legacy code , VF's write request protect timer is only count into PF counter not VF, but VF's read request protect timer was able to be count into VF counter.  

     In MI200, it supports VF, the design behavior is as above description. 

     For VF support hang_protect, it is required because of gfx in baco mode, but Mi200 don't have BACO mode function. So the implementation that {color:#333333}VF's write request protect timer is count into VF counter could be deferred to Floyd. Is it like this for deferred cause?{color}

Hi, Sidney 

  

I don’t think we need to do something just for unified the behavior for dGPU & APU. Just let dGPU mode action like former dGPU and APU mode action like former APU would be safe to MI200. 

  

We don’t want and don’t have the ability, resource and bandwidth to dig out every bit’s history, usage, behavior, just keep the current would be better. 

  

Thanks a lot. 

Regards, 

Vince

Got it. I see the comment from Vince in your attached thread. I think that should be the reason. 

  

Hi, Vince 

  

From Design side, do you want to keep them same to simplify design or just keep current design? We may be able to check with phil whether we can take the strict spec behavior to have same behavior in dGPU and APU from MI200?

And just record one direction of possible solution： 

CVIP-hang-rst-triggered-flush and real-rsp-received-from-IOHUB are 2 different sources in DMA's rsp pipeline.  We just simply assume that, the former one will take over this pipeline instead of the latter one at a propriate time. And now this time is not propriate enough, and this two source seems to be transparent to each other, although they shares the same pipeline.  

One possible solution is:  separate these 2 in timing. 

{color:#333333}real-rsp-received-from-IOHUB{color} should not be transparent to {color:#333333}CVIP-hang-rst-triggered-flush{color}. Instead, {color:#333333}CVIP-hang-rst-triggered-flush{color} must monitor the occupation of the pipeline, and determines when is appropriate to start. 

For example, cvip_hang_rst_gmi_flush_rtr appeads: dma_wrrsp_vld | dma_rdrsp_vld  (or sth else which indicates that real-rsp is occupying the pipeline)， to being prevented hazard in the pipeline.

     The assertion check is using same internal LCLK-mask-signal which is related with NICKCLK_DS_ALLOW. 

It seems that added the LCLK-mask_signal for usb early wakeup. Some cycle-based assertion can’t be handled by TB. 

Instead, there is direct test to cover it.

I have checked your waveform and it's an old issue that we have fixed in nbif main tree. 

the fix CL # is nbif2_0/nbif2_0_main@3924839. 

The root cause is  following code in sdp2axi_arb.vpp 

old: //assign SDP_ReqRdy         = ~P_req_arbfifo_full;//because NP use credit, not need rdy to backpresure 
fixed: assign SDP_ReqRdy         = SST_HST_rxIn_busy; 

in the old version, SDP_ReqRdy uses {color:#333333}~P_req_arbfifo_full{color} as ready signal to backpressure gsi which is a wrong way. 

when p_req fifo is full, and the current trans from gsi is NP, this NP will pending since ready backpressure, however, this NP will be pushed to np_req_fifo Repeatedly –> then np_req_fifo will be full --> and at this time, p_req_fifo_full was de-asserted --> SDP_ReqRdy was released —> new NP trans(201/202/…../209) was loaded to sdp2axi_arb and dropped(why dropped? because the np_req_fifo is full during this time).  --> then the trans with tag ""210"" can pass down to sdp2axi_arb because the np_req_fifo is not full after some cycles. 

  

After all, this issue was fixed after the CL#  {color:#333333}nbif2_0/nbif2_0_main@{color}{color:#333333}3924839{color}

I have send the NBIF_SHUB - MPDMA configuration document through the JIRA to Vinay for fill. This is to collect the detail requirements to nbif_shub as a golden and centralized requirement. It will mostly focus on pcie configuration requirement, AXI/SDP/sideband interface requirements. for other features not relate to this range can be out of this document scope. 

 

Could you help to fill this table by 6/19 and we can have a review together for a signoff later? For further change, you can still file another JIRA for update. 

 

This is not conflict with ICT’s CRB flow. The document is try to get things centralize in one place and easy for sync between IP teams.

NBIF has only one req credit@922376341ps and the credit is used up by SATA0 sideband toggle @921889710ps.

Defect,DEIPCNBS20-845,[Badami] NBIF ENV doesn't take into account if the interrupt lines are enabled or not when performing INTX prediction,"Liu, Bin",,,Closed,"Marinkovic, Bojan",2019/5/14 2:33,2019/7/9 20:36,"Marinkovic, Bojan: Hi Bin, 

Ok, let me see. 

- For NBIF0 PTDMA there are 4 impulses on interrupt line so there should be 4 assert/deassert pairs which is total of 8 INTXs. 
- For PTDMA NBIF1 there is 1 impulse which makes 1 assert/deasert pair and total of 2 INTXs. 
- For SATA0 NBIF1 there are 27 impulses. But, as you explained if different multiple interrupt lines toggle at the same time only one interrupt will be generated for all. So, with that info I see 11 ""merged"" impulses which makes 11 assert/deassert pairs and the total of 22 INTXs. 

- Finally, for SATA1 NBIF1 there are 27 impulses, but there are actually 13 merged impulses which make13 assert/deassert pairs and total of *26 INTXs* . 
Since they are not enabled they do not come out of NBIF1 but still they are predicted since NBIF ENV doesn't take into account if the interrupt lines are enabled or not. 
This explains 0x1a=26 interrupts left unmatched in the predictor queue because there are not seen coming out of NBIF1. 

Great! Thanks for explanation. I'll enable interrupt lines for SATA1 with REGS_INTR_LINE_ENABLE_DEV2 and let you know how it goes.

FLR_CAPABLE has been set to 0 by strap BIF_STRAP_FLR_EN_DEV0_F0.  Am I right? Do we need to fix it in previous VGxx/NVxx projects? 

FLR is optional, except for SR-IOV capable PFs and VFs.  FLR support in non-SR-IOV cards is usually skew-specific (eg. some customers may want FLR, while other don’t).  For the plug-fest cards, we will have to disable FLR due to this H/W problem. 
# The possible negative effects by this H/W issue if PF and VF FLR has been enabled and used?    

If FLR is supported, then RX Margining context will be lost, whenever a FLR is issued to Function 0 (ie. the PF).  RX Margining is not used for normal operation.  So it is unlikely that FLR would be issued to the PF, while test software is using RX Margining.  However, the intention of the Base specification, is that RX Margining continues through FLR (since FLR does not impact PCIe link behaviour). 

  

   >>*Question*: Is the FLR behaviour for these specific RX Margining registers in NBIF EPs controlled by H/W or is this an issue with the RSM ucode’s implementation of FLR? 

>>(Is the non-compliant behaviour a H/W problem or a ucode problem?) 

  

   I have checked the RTL, This FLR behavior is a H/W problem. 

We started the RTL implementation based on cb_pci_express_base_4.0r0.7_october_13_2016.pdf.  This change was missed when we went through the latest spec cb_pci_express_base_4.0r1.0_pref_august_28_2017.pdf 

    

    I saw that the FLR test for these registers are not involve in PCI_Express_Test_Spec_Config_Space_4 0r09_27092017.  Is there any plan to add FLR testing for these registers in future compliance test spec(4.0r1.0 ?). 

There will be a FLR test added in PCIECV 4.0r0.9, called TD_1_999 and included in the official compliance test suite.  This FLR test currently does not include RX Margining structure, and there are no plans (yet) to add it. 

  

The full PCIECV test suite can be run as FYI in FLR mode, and this will test the RX Margining structure.  FYI testing does not count towards official compliance test suite. 

  

   Another question:  Do you have a summary of the changes from 4.0r0.7 to 4.0r1.0?   

  

This is not CB Version from PCI-E Base 4.0r0.7 directly to 4.0r1.0. 

For PCI-E Base 4.0, you can find CB version between interim revisions at: 

\\bender\cvhwfsr01proj\smanning\users\smanning\Specifications\Buses\PCI_Express-(3gio)\Specification\Base\4.0\draft 

  

There is no 4.0r1.0 version of PCIECV Test specification yet.  It is still only 4.0r0.9. 

  

The attached document contains the latest running list of changes between PCIECV 4.0 vs. PCIECV 3.1.  The lines in BLUE, are the most recent changes to 4.0r0.9. 

  

Below is the PCIECV 4.0r0.9, TD_1_74 attribute table.

A PCIeCV 4.0  failure in all SOC15 dGPU products has the HW Default of 2 specific PCIe Config Space registers (Data Link Layer State Changed Enable & Command Completed Interrupt Enable) programed as RO when they should be RW. 

Current NV21 design in nbif SW.DS violate pcie 4.0 compliance test spec test td_1_49, the compliance spec is to be officially released in Aug,2019, then new products after it will failed on pcie 4.0 compliance test. 

The pcie link between SW.DS/RC with EP is virtual link, we assume it will be always active so set the registers to be RO-Zero. 

  

*What’s the fix?* 
1.    A strap option should be added for the SW-DN to control the value reported in No Command Completed Support bit (Slot Capabilities).  The value of this bit would then control the behavior of the Command Completed Interrupt Enable (Slot Control) and the Command Completed (Slot Status) bits. 
2.    Correct the attribute for register below : 
•    Data Link Layer State Changed Enable (Slot Control register) (RO-zero to RW)

Hi Abdel,

 

According to the SYSHUB implimitation table below, ZCN does not have a limit for number of outstanding DMA write requests.


Would it be possible to measure, using your PV tests, the bandwidth improvement from the clients that are affected by this limitation when the enhancement is enabled?

I understand that INTX prediction is difficult to handle by NBIF ENV. Issue is already ""defferred"" for future project. 
To workaround the issue I'll try to delete INTx requests from the predictor queue in the test, since prediction doesn't take into account NBIF RTL OR-ing INTxs with same INTERRUP_PIN value resulting more INTx predicted then generated. This workaround is little bit tricky but doable. I want to avoid disabling whole NBIF ENV just because on issue.

The risk of this problem is very low and the DUT only sends one more error message. 

Typically, the DUT merges multiple error messages into one if those error messages are passed back to back. 

Now our predictor makes a fuzzy comparison of the error messages. 

For old projects,keep now process, such as ssp, genesis. 

Maybe this problem dut fix won't be considered a dut bug, just an enhancement. 

So we don't need to add extra constraints for this to the MAS.

Please correct it as ""It is able to be read/write by SMU through SMN."" 

Remove remove the host-path. Because this newly added is in this 4KB(bif_misc, 32'h101_3a_xxx). All the PG/CG/DEEPSLEEP control registers are in this 4KB. This 4KB is able to access through SMN. Host is also able to access this 4KB aperture, but in NBIF it is not directly access. Instead, host should use SMN-index-data-pair to access it. 

So assume that this register is only for debug use. Please also expose this register to SMU team who is in charge of MP1 firmware.

I think ErrEvent is not the root cause of this assertion. The problem is you're using a lower frequency clock to sync a signal from a higher frequency clock domain, it will always be an error if you're doing this, Shannon theory for sampling should always be maintained. 

If you insist to use current frequencies, I'll tell you that you can turn off the assertion at this particular situation. It won't hurt because the signal to be sampled didn't change that frequently in your case. But I don't think it's a good idea to turn it off forever.

The issue is is resolved by adding delay before delete_intx() so it could give apportunity for traffic to drain. Since the NBIF check is called at the test end calling delete_intx() too early with remaining incomplete traffic will cause the issue. 

Adding delay worked out. It's the test issue.

Hi Noah, 

I added blocks for NTB and CCP/PTDMA into the original diagram, and mark the P2P path that will trigger the deadlock below. 

So for MTS, could you conclude that we do not need ECO for this issue, and we could make one erratum to force MPx to use direct SMN access only?

Yes it requires SMN access but this could be coming from the CPU. 

One way to form the loop would be 

1. CPU performs MMIO read (whose response gets ordered behind DMA writes) 
2. CPU performs MMIO write through the nBIF SMN master – say accessing a SATA or USB register 
3. CCP/PTDMA performs a series of p2p write requests to NTB on the same nBIF instance (CCP/PTDMA->SysHub->nBIF->IOHub->[same]nBIF->NTB->nBIF SW.ds instance->PCIe) 

1 gets ordered behind 3. 3 gets ordered behind 2. 2 gets blocked by 1 (due to the bug where they share a buffer).

Phil or Kendra, does the deadlock loop with NTB also require an SMN access? What does the deadlock diagram look like with NTB? 

I agree that MP0/MP1 would be expected to use SMN directly for SMN accesses, rather than going through IOHUB/NBIF.

I don't think this issue will occur in MTS of we are not using ntb. The only loose end is whether mp0/mp1 attempts to issue requests over the main datapath that go back into nbif to route onto smn. I'm not aware of this happening and they should be able to use direct smn access instead.

Pls be aware, one difference between MTS vs ZP/SSP is MTS don’t have NTB and nbif ntb variant instance. 

Hi, Mahesh 

Do MTS has p2p DMA trans go from NBIF_SHUB and p2p back to NBIF_SHUB? This is the necessary condition to trig the deadlock bug. You can see below diagram and discussion for the detail.

Hi Noah, 

Below diagram shows the deadlock loop in Server/APU projects. 
When the red pipe is occupied with NP Req/Rsp, blue pipe is occupied with P Req, and specifically “P REQ#2” is occupied by Posted Request targeting SMN, deadlock will occur. 

I heard that MTS is going to be tape-out soon, do we still have chance to do ECO for MTS?

So if the x86 cores can still access NTBCCP, then no access by x86 for PSPCCP (of which I assume there is only one) is OK from an NTB perspective. I do not expect PSPCCP to be used for any of the use cases I’m working with.

In dGPU the datapath is much simpler with nBIf connected directly to PCIe. We determined that there would be no ordering between responses and DMA writes in the nBIF datapath and that PCIe would always accept responses from nBIF without dependency. Those simplifying conditions don’t exist in a Processor. 

In Rome, the issue we be the use of PTDMA and there are 2 of them, one on the same nBIF as NTB and another on the other nBIF.

I believe Rome plans to disable x86 use of PSPCCP (Rome x86 only uses NTBCCP, not PSPCCP). Naples may have allowed x86 use of PSPCCP. 
It looks like Navi determined in http://ontrack-internal.amd.com/browse/DENARTL-1136 that there is no deadlock case. Is that because of not having NTB? 

Is there a diagram anywhere that is annotated with an example deadlock scenario?

For ZP, if only NTBCCP (not PSPCCP) is used to access NTB-connected remote system, the path will be like NTBCCP -> NBIF1 -> IOHUB -> NBIF2 -> NTB. There will be no P2P traffic from/to the same nBIF that will trigger the deadlock. 

Below JIRA has been cloned for SSP/MTS/GN for this issue.

Subject: RE: [SSP/MTS/GN] Issue of P request being blocked by NP request in nBIF 

I talked with Greg this morning about use cases with NTB and P2P: 

• For ZP, it is probably sufficient to support NTBCCP DMA from/to DRAM on the local system from/to DRAM on the NTB-connected remote system. I believe the cases here do not look like P2P traffic? 
• For SSP and beyond, it seems like there are P2P cases that may be of interest: 
o NTBCCP DMA from/to DRAM on the local system to/from an NVMe device on the NTB-connected system 
o DMA from/to a network device on the local system from/to an NVMe device on the local system 
o DMA from/to a network device on the local system from/to an NVMe device on the NTB-connected system 
o So we would like to address any deadlock cases that involve PCIe-attached devices and NTB 
• It does not seem likely that anything (now or in the future) would DMA from/to anywhere to/from a SATA device. SATA simply doesn’t lend itself to be written to or read from directly using MMIO. USB is similar. 
• MP0/1 and DBGU shouldn’t require P2P access unless we (AMD) have internally defined some use-case that does use P2P accesses 
• I know less about AZ but it doesn’t seem likely to me that P2P traffic would be directed at the AZ controller 

Does that help?

+Greg in case he has any thoughts on the NTB deadlock cases. 

I didn’t see the nBIF0 bug for SSP filed yet?

Hi Kendra, 

Is there something different about SSP’s nBIF that is has this issue while ZP does not? 
[Kendra]: This issue also exists in ZP. Just learned that you could also help to cover ZP. 
Similar as SSP, NBIF0 in ZP will connect to NTB, so that we will have valid P2P path, and will have potential deadlock with this RTL issue. 
Unfortunately there is no workaround in nBIF design that could help to break the deadlock. 
I am wondering whether we might have any other workaround from high level? 
Phil mentioned that there is one way to map all DF’s host traffic into NP. Since P->NP stalling in the deadlock actually occurs on host traffic targeting SMN (I refined the deadlock scenario as below), maybe we could leverage DF’s capability as a workaround? 

Host Read completion needs to be ordered behind DMA write per PCIE ordering rule -> DMA write will be routed P2P back to the same NBIF as Host write -> Host write targeting SMN is blocked by Host NP request targeting SMN which could not get going because of pending Host read completion  deadlock here 


We don’t have XGBE in SSP; should that be replaced by something else in nBIF1? 
[Kendra]: Yes, no XGBE in SSP, sorry for the confusion. 
So under nBIF1, we have clients PTDMA/MP0/1/USB/SATA/AZ/DBGU 

What do you mean by targeting SMN with P2P traffic? Traffic destined for a device controller like SATA or USB via SMN? 
[Kendra]: Yes, I mean the traffic targeting device controller’s MMIO via SMN, such as SATA/USB’s MMIO. 

I don’t know about expectations for the NTB case of nBIF2. Phil did you have any input there? 

Go ahead and file the bug for nBIF0.

Subject: [SSP/MTS/GN] Issue of P request being blocked by NP request in nBIF 

Hi Noah, 

Recently we have identified RTL issue that Host P request will be blocked by Host NP request inside nBIF. 
When there is P2P traffic which is originated from nBIF’s DMA path and routed P2P back to the same nBIF’s host path, with such RTL issue, deadlock might occur. 
Host Read completion needs to be ordered behind DMA write per PCIE ordering rule -> DMA write will be routed P2P back to the same NBIF as Host write -> Host write is blocked by Host NP request which could not get going because of pending Host read completion  deadlock here 

In SSP/MTS/GN, we have 3 nBIFs and this RTL issue exits in all 3 nBIFs. I would like to check with you if we need ECO in all 3 nBIFs. 
1. For nBIF0, this P2P should be a valid path due to NTB, we will have data flow like PTDMA -> NBIF0 -> IOHUB -> NBIF0 -> NTB 
We would like to raise ECR to request Base ECO for SSP B0/MTS/GN 
2. For nBIF1, I am not sure if such P2P path is valid? 
We have PTDMA/MP0/1/USB/SATA/XGBE/AZ/DBGU under nBIF1, will they issue P2P traffic to targeting SMN? Client -> NBIF1 -> IOHUB -> NBIF1 -> SMN? 
3. For nBIF2, the only DMA client is NTB, is it valid to have NTB’s traffic to be routed P2P back by chip-set at the remote system? Like NTB -> NBIF2 -> PCIE -> remote system -> PCIE -> NBIF2?

about this question: 
DEVICE_CNTL2 is on offset 0x80 and it hasoffset 0x8c in the RTL: 
bifcfgdecp.add_reg(DEVICE_CNTL2, 'h80, ""RW""); 
[Echo] DEVICE_CNTL2 has different offset in SWDS vs EP. this is defined in bif_cfg.rdl as below: 
if (variant == :swds or variant == :rc) 
pcie_cap_base = 0x58 
else 
pcie_cap_base = 0x64

This is expected. 


difference between predictor value and RTL value should be caused by STRAP_LTR_EN* update during run-time. There is no verdi in this VNC, please help to check whether STRAP_LTR_EN changed. 
I suppose it's similar issue as JIRA:DEIPCNBS20-507.

There are many reason will cause interrupt trans be merged/lost, like credit used up, SDP tag used up, long chained DMA trans hold at VC1, toggle too fast to be handled...So it is very hard to predict exactly in predictor. 

In real system level, interrupt sideband will not toggle continuously before SW handle the interrupt event. We have covered this stress scenario in IP level with scoreboard disabled and some direct checker enabled. 

How to update the predictor and when to update it have not been planed in current project.
